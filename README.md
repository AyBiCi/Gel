# Gel

Bukkit plugin for testing sealage of maps.

# How to use it

Use command /gel creategel to instantiate first gel block and then /gel iterate <number> to grow gel by a number of iterations. If gel hits the wall, it will stop so when you see a leakage of gel you know, there's a hole in this place. To kill all the gel use command /gel killgel.
